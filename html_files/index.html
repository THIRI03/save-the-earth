            <h1>Global Warming and Pollution</h1>

            <p>
                I am pretty sure that everyone is familiar with Global Warming, the major problem weâ€™re facing. <br>
                Global Warming causes a rise in global temperatures and gives negative effects to all the living things.
                The high temperature melts down the ice, where the process is leading to an extremely bad condition
                causing the rise in the sea level. Most importantly, the coastal areas would be covered by the ocean.
                Moreover, it is dangerous not only for our Earth, but also for all kinds of living things exist on the
                earth.<br><br>
                There are also many pollutions; Air Pollution, Water Pollution and Land Pollution. <br>
                Pollutions are occured mainly by waste. Gas wastes, plastic wastes and many other things we made
                unintentionally cause <em>POLLUTIONS</em>
                These tiny little cases gather and putting our EARTH in Danger!

            </p>

        <div class="goals">
            <h1>Let's set Pesonal Goals!</h1>

            <h3>
                These are my opinions on what we can do to help save the earth; three achievable goals that
                I can do in my everyday life for protecting the Earth.
            </h3>

            <p>
                The very basic thing to do is the 3Rs; Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. This is such a simple job and I hope
                everyone can perform.<br> <br>
                My first personal goal is to use less plastic; REDUCING which is the most general and easiest task.
                <br><br>
                Today, we can see that many people are using their recycled bags to reduce the usage of plastic.
                People also use tote bags which have become trending and fashionable. I, myself, also use my tote bag
                whenever I go for groceries. It is convenient and helps us reducing the plastic waste in someways.
                <br><br>
                Secondly, use less water. I would say this is a very easy job for each of us to perform.
                In Singapore, all public restrooms have self-closing taps or taps with sensor.
                I personally think this is such a nice way to reduce the usage of water and an achievable personal
                goal in everyday life. <br><br>
                Not only water, we should not waste anything else, such as food, paper and even
                electricity as any kind of wasting is harming our Earth somehow.
                Lastly, I would say people should not always use one-time-used cutlery as they are not
                recyclable.<br><br>
                All of the three goals I set here are mainly focused on pollution which is considered as the one main
                problem that is harming the earth. If people make less pollution as possible, it would be a helpful
                action to save the earth. <br><br>
                <strong>Thank you.</strong>
